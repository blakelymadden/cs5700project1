Project 1

This program is designed to follow the protocol specified in the
project description for project 1 in Network Fundamentals. The program
opens a connection with the host provided on the command line and sends
a hello message to initiate communication. The server is expected to
respond by sending simple math problems, which it expects an answer to,
until a BYE message is sent along with a "Secret Flag". At this point,
the client closes the connection with the host and prints out the
secret flag.

This is a basic exercise in socket level programming following a
specified protocol.
